# Gender Inequality in a Digital World: Perspectives from Digital Demography

## Workshop by Digital Gender Gaps Team (Oxford) @ International Population Conference 2025

Our societies are rapidly digitalising. How does digitalisation affect gender inequalities? How can digital data sources, generated using internet technologies, help us better measure and understand gender inequalities? This workshop will address these questions drawing on the research and datasets being developed as a part of the Digital Gender Gaps project ([www.digitalgendergaps.org](www.digitalgendergaps.org)) led by the University of Oxford.

The workshop will introduce participants to:

(1) research on digital demography on gender inequalities

(2) introduction to applications of social media marketing data for analysing global digital gender inequalities.

For (2), we will introduce participants to the data and machine learning methods underlying global datasets on internet and mobile access by gender developed through the Digital Gender Gaps project and accessible through our web API. Participants will be invited to explore ways in which these data on digital access by gender could be helpful for their own research questions. The workshop is being organised as a part of the [IUSSP Panel on Digital and Computational Demography](https://iussp.org/en/digital-and-computational-demography). The workshop is structured around an introductory talk and three labs.
